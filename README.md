## Real-Life-Git Katas

Welcome to the **Real-Life-Git Katas** repository! This repository is designed to provide hands-on practice for various real-life [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual) scenarios that developers commonly encounter. Each scenario is organized into its own branch, allowing you to delve into specific exercises related to rebasing, amending commits, recovering deleted files, undoing old commits or file changes, and more.

* [Rebase with GitKrakenn](../../tree/rebase-with-gitkraken)
  - Practice the process of rebasing using GitKraken's graphical interface. Learn how to restructure commit history and integrate changes from one branch into another seamlessly.

* [Rebase with CLI](../../tree/rebase-with-cli)
   - Experience rebasing using the command-line interface (CLI). Understand the steps involved in modifying and merging commits through the terminal.

* [Recover Deleted Files](../../tree/recover-deleted-files)
   - Explore the process of recovering deleted files using Git. Learn how to retrieve lost content and restore it to your repository.

* [Undo Old Commits or File Changes](../../tree/undo-old-commit-or-file-changes)
   - Practice undoing old commits or reverting changes made to specific files. Understand the different techniques to rewind and modify your Git history.

* [Branch Commit Recovery](../../tree/branch-commit-recovery)
   - Learn how to recover commits from a branch and integrate them back into your repository's mainline. Explore strategies to handle accidental branch deletions or lost commits.

Feel free to explore these branches, follow the scenarios, and enhance your Git skills by navigating to the respective kata links provided above. Remember to approach each exercise with care and understanding to maximize your learning experience. Happy branching and committing!
